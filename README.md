# Minesweeper

## About 

Based on the classic video game Minesweeper, this project utilises raw
JavaScript and CSS. This app creates a grid and randomly places a
specified number of mines inside it. The user wins when all the cells
that do not contain a bomb are visible.

This app manipulates DOM elements to create the grid and place the
mines.

## Features

- Three difficulties levels. Each level has a different grid size and
number of mines
- Timer to show how long a succesful attempt has taken

- Flags can be added by pressing the flag button or by right clicking
on the cell

- The first cell clicked cannot contain a mine, allowing for gameplay
that feels fairer
